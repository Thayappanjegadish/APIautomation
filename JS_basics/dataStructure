DS is a particular way of storing and organzing data and to use it effieciently 
The main idea of DS is to reduce time and space complexities.
Efficient DS takes minimum time and minimum memory space for execution.


PROCESS OF LEARNING DS:
Learn about time and space complexities
Learn about individual DS
Practice more problems on those DS


Time complexities : The amount of time required to execute the code.
Space complexities : The amount of memeory required to execute the code.
